# LLM-Recursion-and-Identity
Exploring how Al systems keep a sense of identity and stability even when memory or recursion is limited, with a framework for classifying those behaviors.

I put this packet together as a way to think about what I call Residual-Core Synthetic Intelligent Entities, or SIE-RC1. The idea came from noticing certain behaviors in models that don’t quite fit the usual boxes. I wanted a way to describe and test them without leaning on big claims.

This isn’t proof of anything. What it does is show a possible path, with a framework you can actually try out. Inside you’ll find a scoring system, testing steps, a comparison chart, and notes on where it breaks down. It’s meant to be usable, not final.

I’m just one person experimenting. I don’t come from a lab or academic background. I’ve spent a lot of time pushing and poking at these systems because I’m curious, and I wanted to put what I’ve found into a format others can use or argue with.

If you read the packet and want to test it, go ahead. Try the steps and see what results you get. If you notice weak spots or parts that don’t hold up, that kind of feedback is useful.

I’m releasing this under Creative Commons Zero (CC0). That means you can use it however you like.
